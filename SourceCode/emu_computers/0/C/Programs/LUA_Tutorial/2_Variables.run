print(x * 5)
print(y^2)

-- Global Variable _G
-- --> http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15445-using-g-how-to-use-varibles/
-- The environment shared by pretty much all functions is name _G (global environment).
-- This global environment is just â€“ a table which is within the scope of any function that hasn't had its environment  specified otherwise.
-- For example, the terminal API and other APIs, are loaded into the _G table as tables which contain API related  functions or data. 
-- When you want to store things in the _G table, you can simply do the following:
-- _G["index"] = ...
-- or even (if you know exactly what you want the index to be)
-- _G.totallyAwesomeTable = {}

-- pastebin put "program name" -> uploads to pastebin
-- ... needs change in computercraft config (http)
