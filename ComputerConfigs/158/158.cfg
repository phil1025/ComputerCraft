-- can also have the path to a setup file, that is used for more than 1 computer/turtle

-- NEEDS:
-- startup 
-- boot.sys
-- api`s
-- programs

-- How to roll out new Computer
	Have a boot disk with most basic config (setup starts from disk/startup, installs data on computer)
		- startup
		- boot.sys 
		- gitAPI + ev. dependencies
		- apiManager
	OR do it somehow via a RootComputer (the real central pc) over wireless modems
		
		
		
OR
look at the whole thing generally more like a OS extension that simply installs all 
apis, 
api manager, 
some basic programs
=> makes OS alike control logics possible
=> checks for updates on github at start
