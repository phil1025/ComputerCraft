--updates needed on server:
x_Turtles (new Tutorial)
LUA_Documentation

--update needed on local:
obsolete => moving to github

--update from PC 140 to 157(turtle):
apiManager implementation (all)

new files in 158
- gitDEV stuff (most recent)
- NOTE: PC 140 content was moved to 158, better to work on advanced computer.
- GNOOR1S_OS => guide to own OS [DEPRECATED, most recent version is already in repo (\GitRepo\CCemu_Computers\computer\0\GNOOR1S_OS\)
- NOTE: DONT CHANGE ANY CODE IN 158, ONLY VIA GIT PUSH!

computer 159
- is the experimental pc to test and develop own OS with git features. 

------------------------------------------------
SWITCH WHOLE SYSTEM TO WORK WITH FILE ENDINGS => find loadable api files simply by searching for ".api" ending
												 !! So paths can change !!
												 Maybe even place an api identifier inside => api_id = "fileSys"
																						   => api_id = "itemTable_API"
												 So the file name can change later. 
												 apiManager_API will identidy .api files via api_id, so the api_id must never change.
												 So basically hides bad naming behind the curtain
------------------------------------------------
more DB Attributes:
- optimal mining y range => explorer/advMining turtle can go to right altitude for 
- item recipe (if exists)
- depending recipes
- thresholds
- statistics | avg consumption/time, fillRate/time, etc...) => time (year, month, week, day, hour, minute) => draw graph curves with clickable datapoints!
------------------------------------------------
-- IDEAS
- Have a central turtle software management pc with proper gui program
	-> allow turtle setups via wireless modem 
	-> Main Program => turtle sub programs
	
- API Manager => an API that provides easy access to
	         other APIs without need of dirPath
			 
- Broadcast Repeater Program => routing protocol sender->receiver

- GPS Triangulation for Turtles

- Map drawer Program => minecraft map to screen? 

- Setups
-- CREATE InteractiveSorter_Software that allows easier handling => UI´s
-- Make installable setups 
--> SETUP storageExpander: central pc, turtle
--  1. turtle/s to manage storage
--  2. turtle/s to expand storage on demand (dig, place, craft?, setup interactive sorters?)
--  3. central pc commands turtles (equips turtles, starts program (store/observe/expand))
--  4. central pc keeps track of last chest position in order to tell turtle where to go
--  5. central pc stores data to disk
--> SETUP storageInput gate
--  1. no clear concept yet...
-- maybe classify item ids => archive=>storageExpander, deliver=>direct users/demands, process=>recipes/autocrafting, discard=>itemDestroyer  
--> SETUP automatic quarry?!!
--  1. turtles rebuild everything at next location, make setup, deliver stuff to base!

- REPO => sort of a code synchronisation system for local and inGame/server

- Turtle Inventory Registration DB
---> a program to be run as api 
---> allows to register uuid´s for slots, in order to let turtle programs make decisions based on item type => diamond>go to diamond mining level
---> slot purpose [resource, loot, fuel, torches, intersctiveSorter(carrying)]
---> demands that each registered slot contains 1 example item for comparing blocks if no interactiveSorter solution is used

- Explorer Turtle => auto explore and return
- Quarry Turtle
- Basically turtles working together to setup quarries, oil pumps, resource chains to home, etc..

More turtle ideas:
- turtle error status Report sending api
- visualize location / computer map api
- turtle remote control Interface api
- compareto sorting System api -> Group Slots of same Type -> determine items by quantity 
- Slot compare with example item identification
- Slot reserving api 

gathering terrain info:
turtles should store pos xyz and slot id for each mined item. in base Slot stacks get identified by itemsorter => 3d mining history, map colors 
=> maybe in combination with ported itemsorter have a turtle Team dig surface Blocks,  
   identify them and bring them back in place => carthografer turtle  

Turtle program ConstructTunnel aka turtleAPI features:
- place torches, torches reserved slot
- preload stacks in default slots for 13-16 slot materials 
	if a 13-16 stack becomes low turtle checks other slots with compareTo
	if matching stack found transfers it to the involved 13-16 stack
